# The RG40XX-H has swapped audio channels for speakers, but not for headphones.
#
# The new kernel in version 1.0.3 of the stock firmware resolves this bug, but
# we currently use a patched version of an older stock kernel (to fix cardinal
# snapping issues), and upgrading it isn't trivial.
#
# For now, poll spk_state (0 -> headphones plugged, 1 -> headphones unplugged)
# and swap DACL and DACR when the state changes.
