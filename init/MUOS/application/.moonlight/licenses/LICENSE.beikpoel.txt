Hi there,

My name is Jan. I'm part of a group called PortMaster. Is it correct that you (among others) made "en aften ved svanefossen"? 

Its a bit of a bold question, but would you be willing to grant us permission to use this beautiful song in one of our apps?

Our project is completely open source and non commercial. I look forward to hearing back from you ðŸ™‚

Hello! Could I ask what kind of app this is?

JanTrueno â€” 05/31/2024 5:13 PM
Its a front end launcher for a program called "Moonlight". We port games and programs to small linux retro handhelds. Moonlight allows users to stream games from their pc to their handheld.

Oh, so in what context would the song be played exactly?

JanTrueno â€” 05/31/2024 5:14 PM
It would be background music ðŸ™‚
In the frontend, the user can set their resolution, games, etc. 
And ofcourse we would give credits on screen for the song playing.

Awesome! Thank you very much. Fell in love with this song a year ago, and thought it would be a perfect fit ðŸ˜„
