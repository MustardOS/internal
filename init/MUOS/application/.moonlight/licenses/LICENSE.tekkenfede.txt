Also forgot to ask you @tekkenfede. 
I used the portmaster logo and theme music in the moonlight launcher. 
Im assuming its fine, but can i use them? 
And do i need to add a  license or something for when i host it on github?

Sure no problem, more than a little "thanks to" or something like this somewhere is not necessary.
