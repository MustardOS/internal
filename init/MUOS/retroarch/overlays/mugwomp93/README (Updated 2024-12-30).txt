This is a collection of 1playerinsertcoin's Perfect overlays for GB (DMG and GBP), GBC, and GBA bundled with instructions for muOS. I've made some minor edits to the GB and GBC overlays for alignment and have added options with my own borders, but the grids and magic are all theirs. You can check out all of their overlays, including overlays for CRT, GG, and Apotris, on their Reddit profile: https://www.reddit.com/user/1playerinsertcoin/submitted/

My files for the original RG35XX with Garlic OS are on my Garlic OS Github repository (https://github.com/mugwomp93/GarlicOS_Customization).

Note that these overlays have only been tested on the RG35XX Plus with muOS. I have no idea how they look on other devices or with different firmware. Given the differences I've seen so far ymmv (i.e., compared three devices, all three slightly different).

To use these overlays:

     1. Copy the "Perfect" folder to:

        /mnt/mmc/MUOS/retroarch/overlays

     2. See the README files in the relevant subfolders (Perfect_DMG-EX_533, Perfect_GBC_533, Perfect_GBA) for system-specific settings
